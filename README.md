# Quicker Actions

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](docs/README_ZH.md)

This repository is designed to extract information and generate backlinks. Together with two other repositories (which convert extracted information into images and text in Obsidian and Excalidraw, and provide corresponding backlinks), it enables one-click extraction of video, PDF, and PPT content into note-taking software with attached backlinks. When clicking on the link, it can jump back to the original source.

Examples of generated backlinks include video frames with corresponding timestamps, PPT slides with corresponding page numbers, and PDF pages with corresponding positions.

Supported software includes PotPlayer, Bookxnote, Zotero, and PowerPoint.
