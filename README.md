Ever wished you could effortlessly capture key information while watching videos, reading PDFs, or viewing presentations, and have it instantly saved to your knowledge base like Obsidian„ÄÅEagle or Anki? Even better, what if you could click a link in your notes and jump right back to the exact source‚Äîbe it a specific timestamp in a video or the corresponding page in a PDF?

**BacklinkGenerator** is the core engine that makes this workflow possible. It specializes in capturing information and generating precise backlinks to the original content.

## ‚ú® Core Features

This tool is a key component in an automated knowledge-capturing workflow. When combined with productivity tools (like Quicker) and knowledge base plugins, it enables:

-   **One-Click Capture**: Quickly grab video frames, screenshots of PDF/PPT pages, or selected text.
-   **Intelligent Processing**: Automatically send the captured content and its metadata (like video timestamps or PDF page numbers) to your target application.
-   **Precise Backlinking**: Embed a clickable link in the generated note or card, allowing you to revisit the original context anytime.
-   **Broad Compatibility**: Supports capturing from various applications, including PotPlayer, BookxNote, Zotero, and PowerPoint.
-   **Multi-Platform Sync**: Seamlessly send content to your favorite note-taking and asset management tools like Obsidian, Obsidian-Excalidraw, Anki, and Eagle.
